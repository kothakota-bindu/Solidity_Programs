# Solidity Practice Programs
This repository contains beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract examples designed to build my foundational skills in smart contract development and security. As I transition into the role of a Smart Contract Auditor, I am actively practicing secure coding patterns, exploring common vulnerabilities, and understanding real-world contract logic.

## Program List
- `01_SimpleStorage` - Basic storage and retrieval of state variables
- `02_EtherWallet` - Simple ETH wallet with deposit and withdraw functionality
- `03_SimpleVoting` - Voting system with prevention of double voting
- `04_TimeLock` - Contract demonstrating time-based fund locking
- `05_ReentrancyExample` - Contract illustrating reentrancy protection with guard pattern

## Focus Areas
- Writing clean, readable Solidity code  
- Exploring security best practices (e.g., Reentrancy Guards, Access Control)  
- Hands-on understanding of contract logic relevant for auditing  

## Next Steps
I will continue to expand this repository with more examples, secure coding patterns, and smart contract vulnerabilities to deepen my understanding as I pursue opportunities in Smart Contract Auditing.
